**SheetSage2 turns music recordings into lead sheets and timed musical annotations.** Transcribe a complete song, edit its ABC or MIDI, render a piano preview, or extract embeddings and token predictions for your own tools.

Built on [MERT-v2-FullSong](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/MERT-v2-FullSong), with adapters that merge automatically when you load the model.

📄 **Technical report:** [SheetSage2: Coherent Lead-Sheet Transcription with Synthetic Supervision](https://github.com/instr3/YuE/blob/main/docs/sheetsage2_technical_report.pdf) describes the MIDI-derived synthetic supervision, the structured decoders, the autoregressive distillation, and the evaluation protocols behind the benchmarks below.

**Update log:**

**2026-09-24:** Fixed a bug in key-aware chord spelling. Candidate chord tones were spelled incorrectly, which favored sharp-side names for chromatic chords (e.g., `B#` instead of `C` in E major, `A#` instead of `Bb` in G major). Only chord label names change; pitches, timing, key labels, and model weights are unchanged.

**2026-09-21:** Fixed missing enharmonic spelling correction for key and chord labels. Chord spelling now follows the local key. This updates key/chord labels and ABC notation without changing musical pitches or timing.

If you downloaded the repository or model before this update (2026-09-24), please update to the latest repository code. **Model weights are unchanged.**

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## 🚀 Quick start

Use Python 3.10 or 3.11 and FFmpeg 6.1 with its shared libraries. Sign in with access to this repository and its MERT-v2 parent:

```bash
python -m pip install huggingface-hub==0.36.0
huggingface-cli download m-a-p/SheetSage2 --local-dir SheetSage2
cd SheetSage2
python -m pip install torch==2.8.0 torchaudio==2.8.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel

model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    "m-a-p/SheetSage2", trust_remote_code=True,
).eval().to("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

result = model.transcribe("song.mp3", output_dir="output")
```

Files are decoded, mixed to mono and resampled automatically. Long songs use overlapping windows.

| Output | File |
|---|---|
| Editable score | `score.abc` |
| Melody and chord accompaniment | `transcription.mid` |
| Separate melodies and chords | `melody_vocal.mid`, `melody_instrumental.mid`, `chords.mid` |
| Timed annotations | `events.json`, `*.lab` |

Omit `output_dir` to keep results in memory. Pass a Tensor or NumPy waveform with its sample rate:

```python
# waveform: [samples] or [channels, samples]
result = model.transcribe(waveform, sampling_rate=24000)
abc = result["abc"]        # str
midi = result["midi"]      # bytes
events = result["events"]  # list of timed events
```

Paths, encoded audio bytes and binary streams are also accepted. `result["midis"]` contains the separate MIDI parts; `result["labs"]` contains annotation text. Request `export_logits=True`, `export_scores=True` or `export_embeddings=True` for CPU tensors in `result["tensors"]`, grouped by window; add `output_hidden_states=True` for all 24 MERT layers. With `output_dir`, these tensors are saved as safetensors instead. Low-level `forward()` returns logits and optional hidden states; `generate()` returns symbolic tokens.

Save a self-contained model for offline use:

```python
model.save_pretrained("sheetsage2-local")
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(
    "sheetsage2-local", trust_remote_code=True, local_files_only=True,
)
```

### Key and chord spelling

Chord LAB annotations and ABC symbols use the local key at each chord
interval's midpoint to correct enharmonic root spelling, following SheetSage2 LM
(for example, D#/G#/A# become Eb/Ab/Bb in C minor). Timing, chord quality,
inversion and sounding pitches stay unchanged. Without a decoded key, spelling
is preserved. Decoded events and tokens retain the original model predictions.
This applies to both in-memory results and saved exports, including `paper=True`.

Key labels use the canonical LM/NoLM spelling (D#:major becomes Eb:major;
C#:major becomes Db:major; A#:minor becomes Bb:minor) in decoded events,
token display and exported key intervals. Numeric token IDs and the vocabulary
fingerprint are unchanged. ABC melody spelling follows NoLM's key-relative
pitch table, including accidental resets at barlines and key changes.

### Melody-only ABC for covers

Set `melody_only=True` to retain both the `Vocal` and `Ins` melodies while omitting chord symbols from the ABC and chord accompaniment from playback/combined MIDI. Raw predicted annotations remain available; the default full transcription is unchanged.

```python
result = model.transcribe("song.mp3", output_dir="cover-score", melody_only=True)
abc = result["abc"]  # Also saved as cover-score/score.abc.
```

```bash
python infer.py song.mp3 --output cover-score --melody-only
```

Review the transcription, then pass `result["abc"]` or the saved `cover-score/score.abc` to [YuE2](https://huggingface.co/m-a-p/YuE2-3B) as `abc`, with `cot="melody"` and your target `style` and `lyrics`. If the requested ABC cannot be produced, Python raises an error (partial results are available as `error.result`) and the CLI exits with a nonzero status.

### Command line and rendering

```bash
python infer.py song.mp3 --output output

# Optional piano audio and printable sheet music:
python setup_render.py
python infer.py song.mp3 --output output --render-audio --render-score

# Render existing results without loading the model:
python render.py --input output --output rendered --audio --score pdf,svg,png
```

On minimal Linux servers, use `python setup_render.py --with-deps`. Audio follows the original MIDI timing. Scores preserve the vocal and instrumental staves. For separate piano previews, use `--render-parts vocal,instrumental,chords` with `infer.py`, or `--parts vocal,instrumental,chords` with `render.py`.

Python also accepts `render_audio=True, render_score="pdf,svg,png"`. In memory mode, `result["rendered"]` contains `audio` (part → WAV bytes) and `score` (format → pages as PDF/PNG bytes or SVG text).

## 📊 Benchmarks

Scores (%); higher is better. SheetSage2 uses BF16 inference. Use `preset="paper"` or `--preset paper` with the dataset prompts in [scores and settings](benchmark_results.json). Evaluation cohorts, exclusions, metrics, and baseline settings are described in Appendix D of the [technical report](https://github.com/instr3/YuE/blob/main/docs/sheetsage2_technical_report.pdf).

Beat/downbeat F1 uses a 70 ms matching tolerance and excludes reference and predicted events before 5 s for all models. We evaluate 999 GTZAN tracks for beat, 993 for downbeat, and 142 osu2017 tracks for both. Beat This! uses its original inference settings without DBN postprocessing; scores are averaged over three released training seeds.

Melody F1 uses pitch classes with a 50-ms onset tolerance, without note-offset matching. SheetSage1 beat/downbeat results use madmom. *The madmom chord model includes Chords1217 in training. †ChordFormer uses five-fold evaluation, with one held-out model per track. Its original scorer pools metric-eligible durations; we recompute per-track recall and weight it by each reference span to match the other models' scoring protocol. SheetSage2 uses one checkpoint across all tracks.

SheetSage2-AR has the highest point estimate on 12 of 15 benchmark–metric pairs. Bold marks point estimates, not statistical significance.

ChordFormer is the chord specialist on all three datasets. We evaluate its released checkpoints with the official default chord vocabulary and HMM decoder: a five-model probability ensemble on osu2017 and JAAH, and one held-out fold model per track on Chords1217. All use the same frozen references and scoring as SheetSage2: per-track `mir_eval` chord recall weighted by the complete reference annotation span. See [osu2017 and Chords1217 results and reproduction](benchmarks/chordformer.md).

On all **113 JAAH recordings**, SheetSage2-AR exceeds ChordFormer by **5.06 percentage points** in Maj/min recall. SheetSage2-Prober scores **62.94% Maj/min**. All models use the same reference spans, intersected with the audio; metric-eligible reference coverage is **93.87%**. See [JAAH results and fixed-model protocols](benchmarks/jaah.md).

On **all 200 Rock Corpus recordings**, vocal pitch-class note F1 is **67.08%** for SheetSage2-AR and **49.19%** for SheetSage1. The mean includes six empty references scored as zero. Checkpoints and inference settings are fixed, with no time alignment or annotation correction. See [Rock Corpus results and scoring protocol](benchmarks/rock_corpus.md).

### Benchmark updates

- **2026-09-26:** Added Rock Corpus vocal melody results and updated the main comparison to 12/15. Completed the JAAH baseline result files.

- **2026-09-16:** Added Maj/min chord evaluation on all 113 JAAH recordings: SheetSage2-AR **64.50%**, ChordFormer **59.45%**, and Prober **62.94%**. Added per-track scores, metric coverage, and protocol details. Existing benchmark scores are unchanged.

- **2026-09-15:** Replaced the Jiang et al. chord baseline with ChordFormer on osu2017 (**86.55%**), and replaced the literature-only Chords1217 entry with our rescored held-out predictions (**83.94%**). SheetSage2 scores are unchanged.

- **2026-09-14:** Updated beat/downbeat scores with a shared 5-second exclusion protocol. Beat This! was rerun under its original settings, averaging scores across three released seeds. Key metric labels are now consistent with the report (Score).
